  "first-quest-start-event.2": "I disassembled an Auto-Grabber I got from Marnie and constructed this with some of the parts.#$b#Marnie called it a luxury item, but it's pretty poorly made and some of the parts broke while I was taking it apart.$5#$b#I'll need some more materials to complete the prototype, but let me explain the premise of my invention a bit more.",
  "first-quest-start-event.3": "When complete, this device will act as a localized hub for a semi-autonomous machine.#$b#The base model should be capable of locating, collecting, and stockpiling various materials from the immediate area.#$b#Because of its wide functionality, I'm simply calling it a 'Collector'.",
